## ⚠️ Recurring problems in the project ⚠️

 1. The front-end can sometimes stop receiving information from the back-end.

Temporary solution: 
```
Restart the back-end docker
```

2. During the first connection, the back-end is unable to receive its user and therefore cannot check certain information.

Temporary solution: 
```
Refresh your browser
```

3. Seeds for the "Project" section may bug on Apple M1/M2 chipsets
